### INTRO (Trigger for this topic)

I was made aware of a simple android cellphone app which was designed to be "Tinder but for baby names". The UI was simple, a paired
human couple who are expecting or not, would both download the app on their cell phones and link each other. They would then be presented
with different names, organized by gender, on a card which they could either swipe left or right on. The cards are color coded blue and 
pink for male and female names (though you choose the gender of your potential offspring is in the settings), and have a definition 
underneath each name. In the few moments I observed the application, this was the most engaging part of the experience, layering on meaning
to my friends who had the names flashing before me on the screen who themselves probably had never thought exactly the etimology of their
own names. 

After what presumably is many hours of private swiping by the users, the couple can sync up and see which names made it into both their 
preferred lists. 


Another trigger for this feeling of "unseen biases buried in layers" is the sensationalist reporting of parts of the white power 
contingent "rushing" to take DNA tests to prove there white ancestry. While the reporting is about the shock and disbelief the ancestry 
seeker recieves when learning the "truth" of their genetics, there is something more subtle here. Disregarding the almost predictable 
justification that the white power community has promoted, that DNA tests are a vast Jewist conspiracy designed to confuse and ultimately
control the population once again, the labelling of peoples across the globe through phenotype categorization should be questioned. Which
peoples are reserved their own percentages? Are these names chosen by these groups or where they given these names at a later date? Is it
useful to separate different peoples by boundaries drawn by nation states, or by physical geography of continents? The separation of 
Chinese and Korean, but Chinese people who are by no means homogenous due to generations of interfacing with thousands of indigenous 
peoples who reside in China are not separated. There is very real erasure of peoples, and additions of arbritrary and a-historical groups
that start to gain legitimacy the more people socialize/ identify with the labels.
